## Notes from codewars examples

**Slicing vs slice assignment**

**1) slicing:**

```

    b = a[0:2]

```

This makes a copy of the slice of `a` and assigns it to `b`.

**2) slice assignment:**

```

    a[0:2] = b

```

This _replaces_ the slice of `a` with the contents of `b`.

Although the syntax is similar (I imagine by design!), these are two different operations.

-------------------------------------------------------
* use dictionary.fromkeys method to generate dictionary using specified keys and values:

	    example: dictionary.fromkeys(keys, values)
--------------
* Use nested loops to compare arrays number to each other. since there will be one integer, we just need to find one
